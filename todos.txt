1.  Address addgrv errata as follows:
  a.  Add ability to add new fields to the tables as they are encountered in grove files.
  b.  Implement the --override option, allowing existing records to be updated.
  c.  Add more graceful way to fail when the records to be added already exist.
  d.  Implement the --host, --user, and --password options, allowing data to be written
      to remote databases as well as those not owned by the current user.
  e.  Use ordered sets instead of unordered sets for ease of testing.
  f.  Add data to describe variation in AUTOMATE batteries.

2.  Create utility to generate leaderboards from performance stat table.  This would include project,
    grove, and model IDs, any user memos, the target variable, the number of predictors, and such
    performance stats and settings as the user may specify (but including a default set of
    performance stats, depending on the target type).

3.  Create utility to generate data dictionaries.

4.  Create utility to generate commands needed to replicate the desired model.
